The script is used to make an additional sub-database for chem-agent's plot, put 'drug_script' folder in your personal directory and insert in the final part of the script the name of your personal directory (/home/"InsertYourDirectoryName"/...)




For the script to work the folder must contain the starting database `miscarriage_database.csv` and the two sub-database created manually (`drug_smile`, `drug_pa`).
