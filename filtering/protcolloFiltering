#### Per/individual analysis 
starting info:  

List of per/individual variable position 
- COMPARED to hg38 (assuming healthy reference?)
- COMPARED to (Almost)all observed variable sites in humans (gnomeAD, 1000G, Bravo)Compile the most comprehensive list of variants and use it to call variants in the miscarriages samples 


Virtually every genomic position needs to be scored, but we can start from some that looks special  


1. Is it a new variant? --> look for high-confidence singletons/doubletons  

2. Is it in a stretch of homozygosis? --> evaluate RoH (no phased data required) if yes, it is a plus

3. Which are the functional consequences? --> pipeline for prediction 




Pipeline for prediction: 
# per-variant indicators
- VEP (genomic location, consequence, Sift, polyphen) 
- CADD 
- ClinVar 
- pLI, pLOF, LOFTEE
- FunSeq
- NCBoost

# per-gene indicator [set of coordinates]
- - DDDgene set 
- - Essential genes  Wang et al. 2014; Blomen et al. 2015; Hart et al. 2015; goldini et al 2018

# popgen indicators
- negative selection: use ukbb as a population proxy to identify regions under negative selection
- ROH 


###### ACTIONS 
1. make the  most comprehensive list of variants (MCLV)
- download data from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/variation/gvf/homo_sapiens/
- convert gvf to vcf to assist varinat calling 

2. make variant calling 

3. filter for variants that are not in the MCLV 

4. calculate per/individual ROH and merge info 

5. calculate consequences for "novel" variants or "known variants in ROH"
