#### Per/individual analysis 
starting info:  

List of per/individual variable position 
- COMPARED to hg38 (assuming healthy reference?)
- COMPARED to (Almost)all observed variable sites in humans (gnomeAD, 1000G, Bravo)Compile the most comprehensive list of variants and use it to call variants in the miscarriages samples 


Virtually every genomic position needs to be scored, but we can start from some that looks special  


1. Is it a new variant? --> look for high-confidence singletons/doubletons  

2. Is it in a stretch of homozygosis? --> evaluate RoH (no phased data required) if yes, it is a plus

3. Which are the functional consequences? --> pipeline for prediction 




Pipeline for prediction: 
- VEP (genomic location, consequence, Sift, polyphen) 
- CADD 
- ClinVar 
- pLI, pLOF, LOFTEE
- FunSeq
- NCBoost
