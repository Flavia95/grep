Pregnancy Loss (PL) is the spontaneous demise of a pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation and occurs in 10-15% of pregnancies. PL is often the result of chromosomal aneuploidies of the gametes but it can also be caused by small-size mutations, both de-novo or inherited from parents. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is the most accurate method for the genetic analysis of PL but it detects variants of several thousand base pairs, leaving unexplored smaller variants. 
We aim to identify genetic variants likely to cause PL not seen by current diagnostic tools, either because of size or because located in non-coding regions not considered in medical diagnostics. We will build a predictive model that integrate genomic variation and functional annotations, based on the analysis of whole-genome sequences (WGS) of miscarried embryos. 
In a pilot study based on 96 cases, we estimate that 18% of samples are euploid after CGH analysis, therefore suitable for sequencing while the rest present aneuploidies (47%), or is not resolvable by CGH (25%), or drops out for quality issues and maternal contamination (10%). Preliminary WGS analysis of six samples identifies 1M of potentially deleterious variant per sample. We are developing a model to prioritize deleterious variants in the hypothesis that PL is a complex trait with tens of variants acting in homozygosis or compound heterozygosis. Meanwhile, raw filtering of deleterious variants based on simple criteria identified homozygous non-synonymous mutations shared by three samples, showing the potential of developing the full project.
